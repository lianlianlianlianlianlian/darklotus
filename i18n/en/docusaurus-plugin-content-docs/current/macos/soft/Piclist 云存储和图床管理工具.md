PicList is an efficient cloud storage and image hosting platform management tool. Based on PicGo, it has undergone in-depth secondary development. It not only fully retains all the functions of PicGo but also adds many new features. For example, the album supports synchronizing cloud deletion of files, and the built-in image hosting has additional options such as WebDav, local image hosting, and SFTP.

PicList also adds comprehensive cloud storage management functions, including viewing cloud directories, searching for files, batch uploading and downloading and deleting files, copying links of various format files, and previewing images/markdown/text/videos. Additionally, there are more powerful album functions and many new or optimized features.
