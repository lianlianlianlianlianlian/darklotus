To view hidden files on a Mac, you can use the following shortcuts:

1. **Open Finder**: Click on the desktop or open a Finder window.
2. **Use the Keyboard Shortcut**: Press `Command (⌘) + Shift (⇧) +. (period)`. This will toggle the visibility of hidden files.

Pressing the same shortcut again will hide the files.

If you want to view hidden files in the terminal, you can use the following command:

```bash
ls -a
```

This command will list all the files in the current directory, including the hidden files that start with a dot (.).
